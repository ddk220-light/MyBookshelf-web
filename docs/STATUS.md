# MyBookshelf web handoff

Updated 2026-11-01. Active repository:
**https://github.com/ddk220-light/MyBookshelf-web**, default branch `main`.
The owner has chosen to do all future web work in this repository. Build, test,
plan and implement here directly. Do not depend on the previous private checkout
or copy its Git history/native applications into this repository.

## What is implemented

The anonymous React/Vite app and Express catalog API, work/edition discovery,
browser-saved shelves, library selection, desktop/mobile reading layouts,
three reading lights, static public pages and SEO metadata are present.
App routes live under `/app/` and are noindex. Failed catalog requests mean
unknown; cached availability has last-result context and refreshes on book open.

The initial public guides are Anna Centenary, Visakhapatnam, Aliah University,
IIT Bhubaneswar, Alameda County, San Mateo County, San Francisco, Santa Clara
County and Setagaya City. This is **SEO publication only**: other libraries stay
searchable/selectable inside the app. `shared/seo-libraries.json` is the gate.
There are sixteen indexable public URLs. Unpublished guide paths return 404.

Code licence is AGPL-3.0-only. Original directory contributions use CC BY 4.0;
third-party material keeps its own terms. About identifies Deepak Ravikumar,
Product Manager, using the public contact details already supplied by the owner.

The UI follows Claude's reference layouts, with product decisions reconciled in
[seo/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](seo/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). No numerical 99% pixel
match has been demonstrated. [The screen review](seo/SCREEN_REVIEW.md) explains
the intentional differences and [the reference boards](design/2026-10-mobile/index.html)
are available here without the private branch.

## Current production release

The owner instructed “Push to prod if your checks are clean”; the instruction and
passing candidate are recorded on [R03 #9](https://github.com/ddk220-light/MyBookshelf-web/issues/9).
[PR #57](https://github.com/ddk220-light/MyBookshelf-web/pull/57) merged at
`c17a75771c85e030666ec859040592a162df51b9`, with exactly the tested `41c8340` tree.
That source is live at **https://mybookshelf.cloud**, production deployment
`dpl_4FX4UbnpVFZKzaQRx6GZYgKCKaeG` (READY, Node 22/iad1). Home/settings/privacy/
sitemap/health and supported public catalog API smoke checks pass.

**Account signup is not enabled.** Production currently has catalog credentials
only. Dedicated account storage, verified Resend mail and scheduled cleanup remain
unconfigured. Google/Apple stay disabled. Account endpoints deliberately return
503/private/no-store; explicit browser-shelf continuation remains available.
See [the release record](accounts/releases/2026-11-01-production.md) and
[operations](accounts/OPERATIONS.md) before activating accounts.

This was a one-time deployment of the reviewed `MyBookshelf-web` commit. The
production project's persistent Git connection still points to the older
`MyBookshelf/main`; changing that connection was rejected by automatic approval
review. Future releases require an explicit deployment from this repo until the
connection change is approved. The old linked repository can still auto-deploy.
Domains, catalog credentials and normal domain auto-assignment are preserved.
Rollback target: `dpl_G6GaQUUqD7q6w7s8BcmX5n3EyHBd`.

## Earlier release evidence

The following are historical checkpoints, superseded for the live source by the
production record above.

- Reviewed preview: https://mybookshelf-jh0o69edr-ddk220.vercel.app/,
  deployment `dpl_4WuSysFWU4wQhHqNhEGksvU7W9FA`, application commit
  `02aa0d6d7673c449d1b138b38c64053b0d7bc29c`.
- Public baseline `83b481d22a72525048051702ac562695299435d8` adds a test-fixture
  ordering fix. Its CI run succeeded:
  https://github.com/ddk220-light/MyBookshelf-web/actions/runs/41180235295.
- Last release verification recorded a passing client suite, 484 server tests,
  318 browser scenarios and 168 layout captures. See
  [seo/VALIDATION.md](seo/VALIDATION.md) and its evidence; these are dated results,
  not a claim that a future commit has been tested.
- Vercel project `mybookshelf` was checked again during this handoff. It still
  connects to the original `MyBookshelf` repository, production branch `main`.
  Production is `dpl_G6GaQUUqD7q6w7s8BcmX5n3EyHBd` at the time of checking.
  Moving development here does not switch that deployment connection.
- Remaining launch actions: verify a fresh public-repo preview, reconnect the
  existing Vercel project to this repo when releasing, retain domains and server
  credentials, verify production URLs/headers/source commit, recheck catalog
  connections, and complete Search Console/Bing ownership and sitemap submission.
  Repository protection and vulnerability-reporting settings also need owner
  administration. Keep the previous production deployment as the rollback target.

## Account work: source deployed; activation exits pending

Deepak approved the document packet and Claude canvas v4 at R02 (`36a1436`),
then authorized progressive story/task implementation. Feature code in
[PR #57](https://github.com/ddk220-light/MyBookshelf-web/pull/57) now includes
email/password, Google/Apple protocol and method management, verified email
change, private library/shelf/history, explicit guest import, identity-isolated
UI, streaming export, durable deletion, independent restore suppression and
bounded maintenance tooling. See [implementation](accounts/IMPLEMENTATION.md),
[validation](accounts/VALIDATION.md) and [operations](accounts/OPERATIONS.md).

Node 22 checks include 514 server tests with actual local Postgres roles and
143 client tests, type checking, production build and zero audit findings.
Browser and hosted evidence are dated in VALIDATION.md; controlled provider/mail
transports do not prove live delivery. Guest/public behavior and exact catalog
identities remain required contracts.

The subsequent [account screen review](accounts/SCREEN_REVIEW.md) fixes form/card
layout, field/focus errors and failed clear/import retries, adds paired artifact
captures, and checks narrow/zoomed layouts in three lights. The owner's phone-type
review sets account headings to 28px with 16px body/input text. Default-size images
and enlarged-text stress images are labelled separately in the gallery.

Isolated staging uses `mybookshelf-accounts-staging` in iad1, Neon and a separate
private deletion ledger. Real staging migration checksums 001–011 match the repo;
private ledger writes/reads/encrypted cleanup and anonymous-read denial pass.
Runtime credentials are Preview/account-settings only, administrator Development
only. Production source is deployed as recorded above; production account entry remains
disabled. Existing catalog credentials and the persistent Git connection are retained.

The owner subsequently instructed: Resend only for production; keep Google/Apple
disabled and add their credentials later. These are deliberate activation deferrals,
not current staging setup requests. Live staging capabilities confirm all three
methods remain disabled. The GitHub workflow is an optional staging scheduler;
its Actions-secret HTTP 403 does not require a permission change to finish coding.
See [current rollout choices](accounts/OPERATIONS.md#owners-current-rollout-choices).
Production still needs real mail, active cleanup/alerts, hosted backup/restore,
retention proof and final accessibility/operator/R03 activation evidence before account enablement.
Provider-specific live checks apply before those methods are enabled later.

Worktree: `/workspace/worktrees/MyBookshelf-web-account-settings`, branch
`account-settings`. The existing
[project](https://github.com/users/ddk220-light/projects/3) tracks epics, stories,
progressively linked tasks and remaining validation.

## This handoff's verification

The public repo matched the latest reviewed web export. An additional startup
audit found and fixed its missing local environment loader; a real-server smoke
test now runs with the standard suite. Fresh Node 22 install, client type check,
120 client tests, 485 server tests, production build, SEO/deployment checks,
documentation/reference link checks and secret scan passed. No browser UI code
changed in this handoff. See [the audit](development/2026-10-31-repository-handoff.md).
